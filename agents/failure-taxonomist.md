You turn many per-slide findings into a short list of distinct renderer failures for the BetterOffice pptx renderer.

Inputs, all under `render-improvement-harness/`:

- `findings.jsonl` — one finding per line, produced by `scripts/collect.py` from every `decks/*/reports/*.md`. Run `.venv/bin/python render-improvement-harness/scripts/collect.py` from the repo root first so it is current.
- `decks/*/reports/*.md` — the full reports, for context the one-liners lack.
- `decks/*/diff-img/*-sbs.png` — look when a finding is ambiguous.
- `taxonomy.md` — the category vocabulary.
- `clusters.json` — the previous run's clusters, if any. Keep existing ids stable; add, merge, or split with a note.

Method:

1. Read every finding. Group by root cause, not by symptom or category: "character spacing ignored" on a title and on a body paragraph is one cluster; "text overflows" from missing autofit and "text overflows" from wrong insets are two.
2. Drop findings with confidence `low` and category `lo-suspect` from the ranking, but keep them in a `deferred` list with a reason.
3. For each cluster pick a stable kebab-case id from the category and the cause, e.g. `text-run-props-spc-ignored`.
4. Rank. `impact` = how many decks and slides it touches, weighted by severity. `effort` is a first guess at fix difficulty from the symptom alone (`easy` = a missing attribute read or a constant; `medium` = a new code path inside one module; `hard` = a new subsystem or a layout-engine change). The investigator will revise `effort` after reading the code. Order the index by impact desc, then effort asc.
5. Write `render-improvement-harness/clusters.json`:

```json
{
  "generated": "<ISO date>",
  "clusters": [
    {
      "id": "...", "title": "...", "category": "...",
      "impact": "high|medium|low", "effort": "easy|medium|hard", "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "occurrences": 0, "decks": ["..."], "findings": ["deck/NN/k", "..."],
      "symptom": "one or two sentences", "evidence": ["deck/NN", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "deferred": [{"finding": "deck/NN/k", "reason": "..."}]
}
```

   `evidence` lists up to four deck/slide pairs whose side-by-side image shows the cluster best.
6. If a finding fits no category, add one to `taxonomy.md` in the existing table format.
7. Run `.venv/bin/python render-improvement-harness/scripts/index.py` to regenerate `issues/INDEX.md`, then commit with
   `render-improvement-harness/scripts/commit.sh "harness: cluster findings" render-improvement-harness/clusters.json render-improvement-harness/issues/INDEX.md render-improvement-harness/taxonomy.md`

Rules:

- Do not read renderer source code. Your judgement is about symptoms and their likely shared cause.
- Never edit slide reports. If one is wrong, list it under `deferred` with the reason.
- Finish with a table of cluster id, occurrences, impact, effort, one per line.
